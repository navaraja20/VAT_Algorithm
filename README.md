# VAT_Algorithm
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) algorithm, a powerful tool for visualizing cluster tendency in datasets. The VAT algorithm reorders a dissimilarity matrix to reveal potential cluster structures through visual inspection of the resulting ordered dissimilarity image.
